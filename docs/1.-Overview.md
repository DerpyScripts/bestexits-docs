# BestExits

BestExits is an API that allows you to predict what platform a train will arrive at, as well as the best parts of the train to be on for a quicker interchange or exit.

You can find an example of the API in action [on this website](https://bestexits.arturs.site). Please note that this is a very basic implementation with limited features, so it doesn't show the API in all its glory.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> ### Data not complete
> Please note that I am still working on collecting all the data necessary for this project, and so not all stations are supported by the API at the moment.
>
> You can keep up with my progress on collecting data by visiting the [Progress page](2.-Progress.md).

> Please note that the API will only support stations on the London Underground and other TfL services at first.
> 
> Support for most National Rail stations in the London Oyster zone should be out relatively soon, but stations outside of this zone are unlikely to be anywhere in the near future.

If you have any questions regarding the API or the project in general please do not hesitate to contact me by sending me a message on Twitter [@DerpyScripts](https://twitter.com/DerpyScripts) or sending me an email to [mail@arturs.site](mailto:mail@arturs.site). I look forward to hearing from you!
